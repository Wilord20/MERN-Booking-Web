# Done!
I am happy to inform that I have finished my project. A page similar to Booking that was possible thanks to the tutorial of the great Chris Blakely. 

What I used for the project is:
- MongoDB for the database (hotels, reservations, users).
- Cloudinary (Image storage)
- Stripe (Transaction manager, in this case, when making a reservation)
- Render (Hosting service used to simulate a prod deployment)
- React, Express, NodeJS and TS for development.
- React Hook Form
- Tailwind CSS

And, of course, the features of the page and what was put into practice were:
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration using HTTP cookies and JWT.
* Hotel Management: Adding, editing, and viewing hotels.
* Image Uploads: Integrating image uploads, a crucial feature for any booking platform.
*Search, Sort, & Filter: Search, sort, and filter hotels.
* Online Payments: Integrating Stripe for secure and efficient hotel booking payments.
* Booking Management: Implementing the feature to view and manage.
* Recent Hotels on Home Page: Display recently added hotels on the home page, keeping the content dynamic and engaging.
